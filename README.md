# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to further refine the data on retiring employees so as to establish a 
list of eligible employees to approach with an offer of a future mentorship program. 


## Results: 

- 72,458 employees are eligible for retirement based on the title parameters given in the challenge. 
- The largest impact to title is Senior Engineer and Senior Staff.
- When the spread of retirement is issued across departments, Development and Production are the heaviest hit.
- The way forward is not just mentorship, but hiring new employees. Huge expenses in the form of retirement packages, recruiting, new hire salaries
  are all coming up in the near future.



## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 72,458 are up for retirement and will need to be filled
within the next few years. The largest exodus by far will be in the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions. These are highly trained positions
so are very well suited to mentorship. The third largest group is the Engineer group. Engineers and Senior Engineers have specialized degrees and 
training, so we will need to pull in new highers from recent graduates to fill the Engineer postions while utilizing the mentorship program to move 
up exisitng engineers to Senior positions.

Senior Staff positions have a bit more flexibility and cover a wide array of talents and specialties. These positions are based more on career length 
and experience which makes them highly eligible for training. We can tap into existing employees across departments and train and promote from within.

We could potentially find the average of ppl retiring by department versus total department employees. This would give us an easier way to establish whether
have enough potential mentors and mentees. This also lets us know how hard we need to push for new hires.

Another piece that would be helpful but would require new data and tables, would be when those employees selected as approaching retirement actually plan
on retiring. This will help us estimate how much time we have to get the mentor program up and running and how hard we need to push in our new hire efforts
to fill any holes from promoting and retiring employees.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

As mentioned previously, the largest departments with approaching retirees are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff. This large pool of possible mentors
will make it easier to find matches. There is one outlier that we should look into further, only 2 people are retiring soon with the title of manager. 
We should look into this further and establish whether we are misusing the title or underusing it.
